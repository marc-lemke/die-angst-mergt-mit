# 5. Branches anlegen, pushen und lÃ¶schen
<!-- branches in git are just markers which point to commits in history, there is nothing being cloned, created or deleted (except the markers) -->
<!-- git branch -d <branch_name> -->
<!-- git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name> -->
<!-- git fetch --all --prune -->
